# üéâ GlamBooking Dashboard Redesign & Logo System - COMPLETE

## ‚úÖ All Issues Fixed & Features Implemented

### 1. **Logo Upload System** - FIXED ‚úì
**Problem:** Duplicate filename errors, logos not displaying
**Solution:**
- Updated `/api/upload/route.ts` with `addRandomSuffix: true` and unique timestamp-based filenames
- Now supports: PNG, JPG, WEBP, SVG (max 2MB)
- Generates unique URLs: `timestamp-filename-randomsuffix.ext`

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/api/upload/route.ts` - Added unique filename generation and duplicate handling

---

### 2. **Business Logo Display** - FIXED ‚úì
**Problem:** Business plan users saw default GlamBooking logo instead of uploaded logo
**Solution:**
- Created `LogoSwitcher` component with smart plan detection
- **Free/Pro users:** Display default GlamBooking logo (`/logo/Logo_Long.png`)
- **Business users:** Display uploaded custom logo from `logoUrl`
- Automatic fallback to default if custom logo fails to load

**Logic:**
```typescript
if (plan === "business" && logoUrl && !imageError) {
  // Show custom business logo
} else {
  // Show default GlamBooking logo
}
```

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `src/components/dashboard/LogoSwitcher.tsx` (NEW)
- `src/components/dashboard/Sidebar.tsx` - Integrated LogoSwitcher

### 3. **Billing Section** - FIXED ‚úì

- Conditionally displays upgrade button (hidden for Business users)
- Plan-specific messaging

**Display:**
- **Free:** White text + "Upgrade Plan" button
- **Pro:** Lavender text + "PRO" badge + "Upgrade to Business" button
- **Business:** Gradient text + "BUSINESS" badge + no upgrade button

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx` - Dynamic billing section
