## 🛠️ Clerk Dashboard Configuration

### Step 1: Set Redirect URLs

Go to: **Clerk Dashboard → Your App → Paths**

Set these URLs:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Home URL | `http://localhost:3000` (dev) / `https://yourdomain.com` (prod) |
| Sign-in URL | `/sign-in` |
| Sign-up URL | `/sign-up` |
| After sign-in redirect | `/pricing` |
| After sign-up redirect | `/dashboard` |
| After sign-out redirect | `/` |

### Step 2: Enable Social Providers (Optional)

Go to: **User & Authentication → Social Connections**

Enable:
- ✅ Google
- ✅ GitHub  
- ✅ Microsoft
- ✅ Facebook

These will appear automatically in your sign-in/sign-up forms!

### Step 3: Customize Appearance (Optional)

Go to: **Customization → Appearance**

You can override the appearance settings, but our custom styling already matches your brand!

## 🎨 Custom Styling Details

### Clerk Component Customization

Both pages use the `appearance` prop to customize Clerk components:

```typescript
appearance={{
  elements: {
    card: "glass-card shadow-2xl shadow-purple-500/10",
    formButtonPrimary: "bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-500 to-pink-500",
    formFieldInput: "bg-white/5 border-white/10 text-white",
    // ... and more
  },
}}
```

**Key styling:**
- Glass-morphism cards
- Purple-to-pink gradient buttons
- Dark transparent inputs
- Smooth transitions
- Professional shadows

### Background Effects

Both pages include:
- Three floating gradient orbs
- Blur effects for depth
- Subtle animations
- Modern glassmorphism

## 🔒 Security & Middleware

### Protected Routes:
- `/dashboard` - Requires authentication
- `/api/stripe/*` - Requires authentication (except webhook)
- `/api/user/*` - Requires authentication

### Public Routes:
- `/` - Homepage
- `/pricing` - Pricing page
- `/features` - Features page
- `/sign-in` - Sign-in page ✅
- `/sign-up` - Sign-up page ✅
- `/api/stripe/webhook` - Stripe webhook

**Middleware configuration is already correct!** ✅

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Sign-in/Sign-up page shows blank
**Check:**
1. Clerk keys in `.env.local` are correct
2. Dev server is running
3. No console errors
4. Middleware allows the route

### Redirects not working
**Check:**
1. Clerk Dashboard → Paths are set correctly
2. `redirectUrl` prop is correct in components
3. User completes full sign-up/sign-in flow

### Styling looks broken
**Check:**
1. Tailwind is configured correctly
2. `globals.css` has `.glass-card` and `.gradient-text` utilities
3. Framer Motion is installed: `npm install framer-motion`

### "Payment method types" error
**Status:** ✅ FIXED
The error was in `create-setup-intent/route.ts` - we removed the conflicting `payment_method_types` parameter.

## 🎓 How It Works

### Clerk Catch-All Routes:
The `[[...sign-in]]` and `[[...sign-up]]` folder names are special Clerk conventions:
- `[[...]]` = Optional catch-all route
- Allows Clerk to handle multi-step auth flows
- Supports sub-routes like `/sign-in/verify-email`

### Appearance Customization:
We use Clerk's `appearance` prop to theme the auth components:
- Matches your GlamBooking brand
- Dark luxury aesthetic
- Glass-morphism effects
- Gradient buttons

### Redirect Logic:
- `redirectUrl` prop tells Clerk where to go after auth
- Sign-up → `/dashboard` (start using the app)
- Sign-in → `/pricing` (continue where they left off)

---

## 🚢 Production Deployment

### Before deploying:

1. **Update Clerk Dashboard URLs** to production domain
2. **Switch to Clerk production keys**
3. **Update redirect URLs** in Clerk settings
4. **Test auth flow** in production environment
5. **Verify redirects** work correctly

### Environment Variables (Vercel):

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
# ... other production keys
```
