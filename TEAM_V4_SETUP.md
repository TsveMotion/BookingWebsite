# 🚀 GlamBooking Team v4 + Multi-Location Setup Guide

## ✅ What's Been Built

### 1. **Team Invitations via Brevo Email**
- Send branded invitation emails from `glambooking@glambooking.co.uk`
- 7-day expiring invite tokens
- Beautiful email templates with GlamBooking branding
- Welcome emails after account creation

### 2. **Invite Acceptance Flow**
- Public invite page: `/invite/[token]`
- Token validation and expiration checking
- User account creation with password
- Auto-assignment to business with role and permissions

### 3. **Fixed Booking API**
- Updated `/api/booking/[businessSlug]` to await params (Next.js 15 requirement)
- No more dynamic param errors

### 4. **Multi-Location System** (Business Plan Only)
- `/dashboard/locations` - Manage multiple business locations
- Assign staff to specific locations
- Track address, phone, opening hours per location
- Active/Inactive status toggle

### 5. **Custom Roles** (Business Plan Only)
- `/dashboard/team/roles` - Create custom roles with granular permissions
- Define permissions: manageBookings, manageClients, manageServices, etc.
- Assign custom roles to team members during invitation

## 🔧 Installation Steps

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install bcryptjs
npm install --save-dev @types/bcryptjs
```

### Step 2: Environment Variables

Add to your `.env.local`:

```env
# Brevo Email API (already configured)
BREVO_API_KEY=your_brevo_api_key_here

# App URL for email links
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Step 3: Apply Database Migrations

```bash
# Push schema changes to database
npx prisma db push

# Generate Prisma Client with new models
npx prisma generate
```

This will create:
- **TeamMember** table (updated with `expiresAt` field)
- **Location** table (for multi-location management)
- **CustomRole** table (for custom role permissions)
- **User** table updates (`businessId`, `locationId`, `businessSlug`)

### Step 4: Restart Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev --turbo
```

## 🚨 Known Lint Errors (Safe to Ignore)

These errors exist because Prisma Client hasn't been regenerated yet. They will be fixed after running `npx prisma generate`:

- `expiresAt` field not recognized
- `businessId` field not recognized
- `location`, `customRole` models not recognized

**These will automatically resolve after migration!**
