## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables
Add to `.env.local`:
```env
# Brevo Email API (already configured)
BREVO_API_KEY=your_brevo_api_key

# App URL for email links
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Optional: Cron job security
CRON_SECRET=your_random_secret_string
```

### 2. Set Up Cron Job for Reminders

#### Option A: Vercel Cron Jobs (Recommended for Production)
Create `vercel.json` in project root:
```json
{
  "crons": [{
    "path": "/api/bookings/reminders",
    "schedule": "0 9 * * *"
  }]
}
```
This runs daily at 9 AM UTC to send reminders.

#### Option B: External Cron Service (EasyCron, cron-job.org)
1. Sign up for a cron service
2. Create a job that hits: `https://your-domain.com/api/bookings/reminders`
3. Set schedule: Daily at 9 AM
4. Add header: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET`

#### Option C: Manual Testing (Development)
```bash
# Test reminder system manually
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/bookings/reminders \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET"
