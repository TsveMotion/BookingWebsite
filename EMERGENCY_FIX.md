# 🚨 EMERGENCY DATABASE FIX - Run These Commands

## The Problem
Your schema has new fields but the database doesn't have them yet:
- `Service.category` doesn't exist
- `Service.active` doesn't exist  
- `Client.notes` doesn't exist
- `ServiceAddon` table doesn't exist

## 🔧 THE FIX (Run in Terminal)

### Option 1: Quick Push (RECOMMENDED)
```bash
npx prisma db push --accept-data-loss --force-reset
```

### Option 2: If Option 1 Fails
```bash
# Step 1: Reset migrations
npx prisma migrate reset --force

# Step 2: Push schema
npx prisma db push --accept-data-loss

# Step 3: Generate client
npx prisma generate
```

### Option 3: Nuclear Option (If everything fails)
```bash
# Delete migration history
rm -r prisma/migrations

# Push schema directly
npx prisma db push --accept-data-loss

# Generate client
npx prisma generate
```

## ✅ Verify It Worked

After running the commands, you should see:
```
🚀  Your database is now in sync with your Prisma schema.
✔ Generated Prisma Client
```

## 🎯 Then Restart Your Server

```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C if running)
npm run dev --turbo
```

## 📋 What These Commands Do

- `db push` = Sync schema to database WITHOUT creating migration files
- `--accept-data-loss` = Allow changes that might lose data (safe since this is dev)
- `--force-reset` = Delete and recreate database
- `prisma generate` = Update TypeScript types for Prisma Client

## 🔍 After Fix, Test These:

1. Navigate to `/dashboard/services` - should load with no errors
2. Click "Add Service" - should save successfully
3. Navigate to `/dashboard/clients` - should load with no errors
4. Click "View" on a client - notes should be saveable
