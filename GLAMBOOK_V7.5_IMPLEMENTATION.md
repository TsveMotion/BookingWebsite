#### Database
```prisma
model RetentionCampaign {
  id              String        @id @default(cuid())
  userId          String
  name            String
  type            String
  subject         String
  body            String        @db.Text
  status          String        @default("draft")
  daysInactive    Int?
  discountPercent Int?
  lastSent        DateTime?
  sentCount       Int           @default(0)
  logs            CampaignLog[]
}

model CampaignLog {
  id          String            @id @default(cuid())
  campaignId  String
  clientId    String
  status      String            @default("sent")
  sentAt      DateTime          @default(now())
  campaign    RetentionCampaign @relation(...)
  client      Client            @relation(...)
}
```

#### CRON Job
```json
// vercel.json
{
  "path": "/api/retention/run",
  "schedule": "0 10 * * *"  // Daily at 10:00 AM UTC
}
```

**What the CRON Does:**
1. Finds all active campaigns
2. For each campaign, identifies eligible clients
3. Sends personalized emails using templates
4. Logs each send in CampaignLog
5. Updates campaign sentCount and lastSent

---

### **3. Business Info + Multi-Location System** ✅

**Location:** `/dashboard/locations`

#### Two-Section Layout

**A. Business Profile Section (Top)**
- ✅ Business Name
- ✅ Booking URL (with copy button)
- ✅ Address
- ✅ Phone
- ✅ Description
- ✅ **VAT Number** (NEW)
- ✅ **Certificate URL** (NEW)
- ✅ Save button with loading state

**B. Locations Section (Below)**
- ✅ Location cards with name, address, phone, manager
- ✅ Staff count display
- ✅ Active/Inactive status badges
- ✅ Edit and Delete buttons
- ✅ **Centered Add Location Modal**

#### Plan-Based Limits

| Plan | Max Locations |
|------|---------------|
| Free | 1 |
| Pro | 1 |
| Business | ∞ |

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Enforced in API
if ((plan === 'free' || plan === 'pro') && existingLocations >= 1) {
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: 'Upgrade to Business plan for multiple locations' },
    { status: 403 }
  );
}
```

**UI Behavior:**
- Free/Pro users see "Upgrade to Business" button after adding 1 location
- Business users see "Add Location" button always
- Clear upgrade prompts with plan limits displayed

#### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/locations` - List all locations
- `POST /api/locations` - Create location (with plan validation)
- `PATCH /api/locations/[id]` - Update location
- `DELETE /api/locations/[id]` - Delete location

#### Database Updates
```prisma
model User {
  vatNumber   String?
  certificate String?
  // ... existing fields
}

model Location {
  manager String?  // NEW field
  // ... existing fields
}

model Client {
  birthday DateTime?  // NEW for birthday campaigns
  // ... existing fields
}
```

---

## 🧮 Loyalty Points Logic

### Points Earning (Auto-awarded on booking completion)
```typescript
const settings = await getLoyaltySettings(userId);

if (!settings.enabled) return; // Skip if disabled

const isFirstBooking = await checkIfFirstBooking(clientId);

let points = (bookingAmount * settings.pointsPerPound) + settings.bonusPerBooking;

if (isFirstBooking) {
  points += settings.welcomeBonus;
}

// Add to client's balance
await updateLoyaltyPoints(clientId, points);
```

### Points Redemption
```typescript
const settings = await getLoyaltySettings(userId);
const clientPoints = await getClientPoints(clientId);

if (pointsToRedeem < settings.minimumRedemption) {
  throw new Error('Below minimum redemption threshold');
}

const discount = pointsToRedeem / settings.redemptionRate;
// Apply discount to booking
// Deduct points from client balance
```

## 💡 How It All Works Together

### Scenario 1: New Client Journey
1. Client books first appointment → Receives `welcomeBonus` points
2. After 7 days → Receives "Welcome" campaign email (if active)
3. Completes booking → Earns points based on `pointsPerPound` + `bonusPerBooking`
4. 60 days of no activity → Receives "We Miss You" email with discount

### Scenario 2: Business Owner Workflow
1. Configure loyalty settings at `/dashboard/loyalty/settings`
2. Create retention campaigns at `/dashboard/loyalty/campaigns`
3. Activate campaigns to start auto-sending
4. Add business locations at `/dashboard/locations`
5. Monitor campaign performance via sent counts

### Scenario 3: CRON Execution
1. Daily at 10:00 AM UTC, Vercel triggers `/api/retention/run`
2. Fetches all active campaigns
3. For each campaign, finds eligible clients based on type
4. Sends personalized emails using templates
5. Logs each send to database
6. Updates campaign stats

## 🐛 Known Limitations & Next Steps

### Requires Prisma Generate
**All TypeScript lint errors** are due to Prisma Client not being regenerated after schema changes.

**Fix:**
```bash
# Close dev server
npx prisma generate
# Restart dev server
npm run dev
```

### Not Yet Implemented
- [ ] Loyalty dashboard with charts (API ready at `/api/loyalty/summary`)
- [ ] Auto-award points on booking status = "completed"
- [ ] Location assignment to bookings
- [ ] Stripe integration for SMS credit purchases

### Recommended Enhancements
- Add email preview in campaign modal
- A/B testing for campaigns
- Advanced segmentation (by service type, spending tier)
- Push notifications alongside emails
- Multi-language support for templates
