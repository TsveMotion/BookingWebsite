## üö® CRITICAL: RUN THESE COMMANDS

```powershell
# 1. Install new packages
npm install nodemailer pdf-lib @types/nodemailer

# 2. Generate Prisma Client (adds Invoice model)
npx prisma generate

# 3. Push database schema
npx prisma db push

# 4. Restart dev server (if running)
# Press Ctrl+C to stop, then:
npm run dev
```

**Why?**
- Prisma doesn't know about the `Invoice` model until you run `generate`
- The webhook lint error will disappear after regeneration
- New packages needed for PDF and email functionality
