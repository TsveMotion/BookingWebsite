## üêõ KNOWN LINT ERRORS (Temporary)

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Will resolve after IDE TypeScript refresh

```
Property 'invoices' does not exist on type 'Booking'
```

**Why:** Prisma Client was regenerated with `npx prisma db push`, but TypeScript in the IDE hasn't fully refreshed the types yet.

**Fix Options:**
1. Restart TypeScript server in VS Code: `Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí "TypeScript: Restart TS Server"
2. Restart VS Code completely
3. Run `npx prisma generate` again
4. Close and reopen the file

**After fix:** All lint errors disappear, API compiles successfully.
