## 🐛 If Something Doesn't Work

### Sign-in/Sign-up page blank?
```bash
# Check Clerk keys in .env.local:
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...

# Restart dev server:
npm run dev
```

### Payment modal still errors?
```bash
# Check console for specific error
# Should see no "payment method types" errors now

# If still broken, hard refresh:
Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
```

### Redirects not working?
**Check Clerk Dashboard:**
1. Go to: https://dashboard.clerk.com
2. Your App → Paths
3. Set:
   - After sign-in: `/pricing`
   - After sign-up: `/dashboard`
