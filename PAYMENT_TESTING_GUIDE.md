# üß™ Payment Flow Testing Guide

## Critical Fix Applied ‚úÖ

**Issue Found:** The webhook was missing the `invoice.payment_succeeded` event handler, which is the PRIMARY event that fires when a subscription payment completes successfully.

**Solution:** Added comprehensive webhook handling for `invoice.payment_succeeded` to update the database when payments succeed.

## How Stripe Subscription Payments Work

### Event Flow
1. User clicks "Subscribe" button
2. Frontend calls `/api/stripe/create-subscription-intent`
3. Backend creates Stripe subscription with `payment_behavior: 'default_incomplete'`
4. User enters payment details and confirms
5. **CRITICAL**: Stripe fires `invoice.payment_succeeded` when payment completes
6. Webhook handler updates database: `plan: 'free'` ‚Üí `plan: 'pro'` or `plan: 'business'`
7. User sees updated subscription status

### Why `invoice.payment_succeeded` is Critical
- `customer.subscription.created`: Fires when subscription is created (BEFORE payment)
- `customer.subscription.updated`: Fires on subscription changes
- **`invoice.payment_succeeded`**: Fires when payment ACTUALLY succeeds ‚úÖ (This updates the plan!)
- `invoice.payment_failed`: Fires when payment fails

## Manual Testing Steps

### Prerequisites
1. **Stripe CLI installed**: Download from https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli
2. **Webhook forwarding running**: See setup below
3. **Test card ready**: Use `4242 4242 4242 4242`

### Setup Webhook Forwarding

```powershell
# Login to Stripe CLI
stripe login

# Forward webhooks to local server
stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook

# This will output a webhook secret like: whsec_xxxxx
# Copy this and add to your .env.local file:
# STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxx
```

### Test Scenario 1: Pro Monthly Subscription

1. **Start the dev server**
   ```powershell
   cd d:\glambookingfull\BookingWeb
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start Stripe webhook forwarding** (in separate terminal)
   ```powershell
   stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook
   ```

3. **Navigate to billing page**
   - Go to: http://localhost:3000/dashboard/billing
   - Check current plan (should be "FREE")

4. **Subscribe to Pro Monthly**
   - Click "Get Started" under Pro plan
   - Select "Monthly" billing
   - Click "Subscribe Now"

5. **Enter test payment details**
   - Card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Expiry: Any future date (e.g., `12/25`)
   - CVC: Any 3 digits (e.g., `123`)
   - Name: Test User
   - Postal: Any code (e.g., `12345`)

6. **Complete payment**
   - Click "Subscribe Now" button
   - Wait for success message

7. **Verify in terminal logs**
   Look for these logs in your dev server terminal:
   ```
   üîî Webhook received: invoice.payment_succeeded
   üí≥ Payment succeeded for customer: cus_xxxxx subscription: sub_xxxxx
   ‚úÖ Updating user: user_xxxxx to plan: pro status: active
   ‚ú® User updated successfully! Plan is now: pro
   üìß Sending confirmation email to: user@example.com
   ‚úÖ Email sent successfully
   ‚úÖ Webhook processed successfully
   ```

8. **Verify in database**
   - Refresh the billing page
   - Plan badge should now show "PRO"
   - Database should show: `plan: "pro"`, `subscriptionStatus: "active"`

9. **Verify in Stripe Dashboard**
   - Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/subscriptions
   - Find your subscription
   - Status should be "Active"

### Test Scenario 2: Business Yearly Subscription

Repeat the same steps as above but:
- Choose "Business" plan instead of "Pro"
- Select "Yearly" billing
- Verify final plan is "business" in database

### Test Scenario 3: Payment Failure

1. Use failing test card: `4000 0000 0000 0002`
2. Complete the form and submit
3. Payment should fail
4. Verify user remains on "FREE" plan
5. Check logs for: `üíî Payment failed for customer:`

### Test Scenario 4: Subscription Cancellation

1. After successful subscription, cancel it in Stripe Dashboard
2. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/subscriptions
3. Find your subscription and click "Cancel subscription"
4. Check webhook logs for:
   ```
   ‚ùå Subscription deleted for customer: cus_xxxxx
   üîÑ Reverting user: user_xxxxx to free plan
   ‚úÖ User reverted to free plan
   ```
5. Verify user is back on "FREE" plan

## Automated Testing

### Run Test Suite

```powershell
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run webhook tests
npx ts-node tests/webhook-test.ts
```

### Expected Test Results

```
‚úÖ Webhook Endpoint: Endpoint is accessible
‚úÖ Customer Creation: Customer created and retrieved successfully
‚úÖ Subscription Creation: Subscription created successfully
‚úÖ Webhook Event Construction: Test event payload constructed successfully
‚úÖ Webhook Endpoints: Found X webhook endpoint(s)
‚úÖ Required Webhook Events: All 6 required events are supported
‚úÖ Database Connection: Database connection successful

Pass Rate: 100%
```

## Debugging Common Issues

### Issue 1: "Webhook signature verification failed"

**Cause:** `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is incorrect or missing

**Fix:**
1. Run `stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook`
2. Copy the webhook secret from output
3. Update `.env.local`: `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxx`
4. Restart dev server

### Issue 2: Plan not updating after payment

**Cause:** Webhook not receiving events

**Fix:**
1. Ensure Stripe CLI is running: `stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook`
2. Check terminal logs for webhook events
3. Verify webhook secret is correct

### Issue 3: "User not found for customer"

**Cause:** Customer was created but not linked to user in database

**Fix:**
1. Check that `stripeCustomerId` is being saved when customer is created
2. Verify user exists in database
3. Check logs for customer ID and user ID matching

### Issue 4: Database not updating despite successful webhook

**Cause:** Prisma client might need regeneration

**Fix:**
```powershell
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
```

## Monitoring Webhooks in Production

### Stripe Dashboard
1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
2. Click on your webhook endpoint
3. View event logs and retry failed events

### Application Logs
Monitor your application logs for these patterns:
- ‚úÖ Success: `‚ú® User updated successfully! Plan is now: pro`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: `‚ö†Ô∏è User not found for customer:`
- ‚ùå Error: `‚ùå Webhook handler error:`
